# RECOMMENDED APPROACH for chatbot and how Chatbot use the dto.py:
# 1. Client always sends: ChatMessageRequest (free-form text)
# 2. Backend receives: ChatMessageRequest
# 3. Backend uses LLM/parser to detect intent:
#    - If the user message is like command-like → convert to StructuredQueryRequest internally
#    - If the user message is like conversational → treat as FreeFormQueryRequest internally
# 4. Backend processes accordingly


"""
DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for the chatbot API.

Even though the user's query text is free-form and unstructured,
we still need DTOs to:
1. Define the API contract (request/response structure)
2. Validate required fields and data types
3. Handle metadata (user_id, session_id, timestamps, etc.)
4. Enable API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
5. Type safety and IDE support
